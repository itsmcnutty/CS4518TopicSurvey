## Topic Survey Proposal

**Team Number:** 1042

**Team Members:** Jack Palmstrom, Evan Plevinsky

**Link to hellocharts-android library:** https://github.com/lecho/hellocharts-android

### Topic Overview

For our team's topic survey, we will be exploring graphing libraries for data analytics. More
specifically, we will be using the graphing/charting library hellocharts-android. This library aids
in the creation of animated charts as well the charts themselves, such as
auto-generating the axises. We plan to create an application around data analytics. The application
will revolve around graphically showing the user analytical data on their spending habits. The application
will consist of a form that the user fills out about their spending habits for a given day. This
info will then be stored in an SQLite database. On a separate page of the application, the user will
be able to see their total weekly spending habits as well as their day-by-day spending habits in
chart form. Our team's example will walk a user through how to connect data stored in a SQLite
database to its visual form using hellocharts-android.


### Topic Justification

With the ever increasing reliance on computing, we are able to collect and analyze datasets that are larger than ever before.
Many large companies have the resources to do analysis on data from its users, but there are few
tools for mobile users to see this data. Additionally, many people do not have the time
or energy to track their own habits, such as with our example of budgeting. By giving users a quick
insight into their spending habits through the form of a chart, they are better equipped to make
smart and informed decisions about themselves. Moreover, data analytics are useful in a wide-variety
of applications. Therefore, creating a guide to make using these tools faster and easier is
advantageous. Many developers may be turned off to making this a feature of their application due
to the amount of overhead it would take to set up. By using hello-charts to simplify this process
in creating visually appealing charts, developers may be more likely to add this feature to their application
for their users.
