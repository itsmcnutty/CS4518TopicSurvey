## Topic Survey Proposal

**Team Number:** 1042

**Team Members:** Jack Palmstrom, Evan Plevinsky

### Topic Overview

For our team's topic survey, we will be exploring graphing libraries for data analytics. More
specifically, we will be using the graphing/charting library hellocharts-android. This library aids
in making animated charts as well as assisting in creating the charts themselves, such as
auto-generating the axises. We plan to create an application around data analytics. The application
will revolve around graphically showing the user analytics on their spending habits. The application
will consist of a form that the user fills out about their spending habits for a given day. This
info will then be stored in an SQLite database. On a seperate page of the application the user will
be able to see their total weekly spending habits as well as their day-by-day spending habits in
chart form. Our team's example will walk a user through how to connect data stored in a SQLite
database to chart form using hellocharts-android.
